                The book is written in chronological order. Words are the carrier of urban flow, and signboards are the barrage of a city. We have collected pictures of signboards from the 1940s to the present. Our book also unfolds in the form of bullet screen, in today's rapid development of the city, the signboard characters as ten or even decades of old residents witness the city's changes. Signboard characters carry the traces of city characters for nearly a hundred years. Different signboard characters in the city have become the records of economy, commerce and culture in different times of the city. They also witness the food, handicraft industry and daily space inherited from the traditional way of life. Signboards and other carriers become the cultural skin of the city. We explore the collective era memory and background, as well as the signboards of current Shanghai. Signboards have become the spokesmen of urban culture, as well as the voice of buildings, streets and cities.
